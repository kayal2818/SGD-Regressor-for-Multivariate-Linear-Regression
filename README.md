# SGD-Regressor-for-Multivariate-Linear-Regression

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the price of the house and number of occupants in the house with SGD regressor.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
```
1. initialize weights
2. predict output
3. compute error
4. update weights
```
## Program:
```

Program to implement the multivariate linear regression model for predicting the price of the house and number of occupants in the house with SGD regressor.
Developed by: V.KAYALVIZHI
RegisterNumber:  25018351
from sklearn.linear_model import SGDRegressor
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Features and target
X = np.array([
    [2, 80, 50],
    [3, 60, 40],
    [5, 90, 70],
    [7, 85, 80],
    [9, 95, 90]
])
y = np.array([50, 45, 70, 80, 95])

# Feature scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Create SGD Regressor
sgd_reg = SGDRegressor(max_iter=1000, learning_rate='invscaling', eta0=0.01, random_state=42)
sgd_reg.fit(X_scaled, y)

# Coefficients and intercept
print("Weights (coefficients):", sgd_reg.coef_)
print("Intercept:", sgd_reg.intercept_)

# Predictions
y_pred = sgd_reg.predict(X_scaled)
print("Predicted values:", y_pred)

## Result:
Thus the program to implement the multivariate linear regression model for predicting the price of the house and number of occupants in the house with SGD regressor is written and verified using python programming.
